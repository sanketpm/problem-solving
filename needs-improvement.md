**Heap**
- how heap works with tuples
- how push & pop is done in heap

**Recursion**
- drawing a recursion tree, I always select unnecessary or un-intuitive param for a recursion tree
?: see `Neetcode` & `Striver`'s recursion tree to understand their approach towards it

**DP**
- Still a unclear about `optimal substructure`, why is it important? not all 'overlapping subproblem' leads a 
dynamic programmming solution (possible iff problem has optimal substructure)

**Preparation:**
- No clear deadline set in mind
- No fixed question to solve per day ( I solve atleast 1 every day )
- No fixed end goal or company in mind
- NO PROPER REVISION STRATEGY ( I revise on go, as when required )
